 based on the respective marker's 
contribution to the PCA reconstruction based on the reference database.


To complete the first phase, we collect full-resolution motion capture 
data of hand in a small capture region. 
Specifically, our actor wears 13 small
(approx. 6mm) markers directly on the hands as well as three larger 
markers on the lower forearm. 
The lower forearm acts as the root of our hand. Some of the recorded 
captures act as our database. Our database contains two versions of the 
alphabet signed by the same person and has 6750 frames. The other 
captures are used as input to our system to be fully reconstructed. \\

All of the markers in our captures are labeled in Vicon Blade and 
read into a program that maps the marker data to a hand model. As 
this mapping occurs, certain information is extracted from the program. 
These include joint angles for all of the joints in the model hand (18) 
over every frame and the location of each marker. Joint angles are 
represented as Euler angles. Marker positions for every capture are 
put into the same coordinate frame by determining the offset of each 
marker from the root body (forearm). \\
