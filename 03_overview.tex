
\section{Overview}
Our overall technique is divided into two stages: 1) the computation  
of the sparse marker dataset; and 2) reconstruction from the sparse 
marker set to full-resultion, skeleton-driven hand animation.
%The  system reconstructs hand motion sequences from low 
%dimensional data. The initial data has a small number of markers that, 
%on their own, would not be able to fully convey sign language poses 
%and sequences. High quality animations are created by mapping our low 
%dimensional data to a series of joint angles described in 
%principle component space. \\

We then set up a locally 
weighted regression model to map the marker positions to joint angles 
in principle component space. \\
