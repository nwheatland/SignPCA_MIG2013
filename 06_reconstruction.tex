
\section{Reconstruction}


A small number of markers alone cannot produce a fully
realized signing hand animation. To compensate for the 
information loss, we build a regression model 
to construct joint angle measurements for every joint over 
every frame. 
Using PCA, we can also construct an optimal marker set to represent our 
low dimensional data. 

%We test our method on a variety sign language 
%sequences. 

We determine the quality of these animations
by comparing the reconstructed joint angles to ground truth
original data. Our method also employs the principle
component analysis (PCA), and we can access quality by 
comparing the components of the reconstructed joint angles
to the componenets of original joint angles.
